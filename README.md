Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was to learn how to build a simple web application, to actually deep dive on how various visual and text elements where created.

We started on learninng on how to have a developers mindset and to break down each problem we face to small problems and solve them one by one.
Following that we learnt on to use the command line  and how to use from a very top level Git Hub

After that we used HTML to structure the web ,CSS to add style and visual interest and finally JavaScript to add logic and interactivity to our website

This prework study guide can we used in a variety of ways. In particular the module regading the mindset of the developer is extremly helpful for anyone wanting to start coding as it helps change your mindset to one of a developer

A helpful tips is while in Visual Studio you can always "Open the index.html file in your browser and navigate to the console in Chrome DevTools." so you can see what changes you have made to your code and how it effects the website you are building
